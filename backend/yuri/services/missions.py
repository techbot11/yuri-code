        the candidates — cancelling the wrong mission is worse than asking.

        Exact titles are matched BEFORE id prefixes, inverting design §8.1's

        fragment at all (see _ID_FRAGMENT_RE). Nothing reachable before is lost:
        a full id is still matched first, by primary key.

        The deictic step yields to a real name for the same reason. Half of

          the mission first, which stops its agents, then delete.
        - detaches, never deletes, the sessions that pointed at it. A session
          row is the record of an agent session that really ran; losing its
          mission orphans the link, not the history. This also satisfies the
          sessions.mission_id foreign key, which would otherwise refuse the
          delete outright.
        - leaves the mission's events in place. They are an append-only audit
          log, and the deletion is itself logged as mission.deleted.

        not be able to fire a destructive delete on a mishearing.
