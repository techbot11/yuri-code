"""RosterService — the roster of named specialists (spec §5, §6).

A `Specialist` is what a workflow task actually gets dispatched to: this
service is CRUD plus the two things that make roles usable at all --

  seed()      puts the six BUILTINS (domain/specialist.py) into a fresh
              store, remapped onto a provider the user actually runs.
  candidates()/resolve()   turn a task's `role` + `requires` into an actual
              specialist, deterministically and with no model call --
              §7.9's routing has to be testable and replayable, not a guess.

No task may create tasks and no provider talks to this service directly (see
the plan's §Global Constraints); it is reached only through WorkflowEngine and
the API/voice-tool layer above it.
