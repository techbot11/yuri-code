"""WorkflowEngine — the orchestrator (spec §8, bounds §12).

It owns exactly ONE decision: what happens next. It never talks to a provider.
`dispatch` is an injected coroutine (the container wires it to SessionService
in Task 10, the same way `MissionService.stop_sessions` is injected), and
`dispatch is None` is a real, supported mode — a dry run that schedules
nothing. That is what makes the scheduler testable before a single session
exists, and it is also the state the process is in for the instant between
construction and wiring, when `advance()` must not pretend it started work.

Two properties carry the whole design and are each pinned by a test:

  advance() refuses unless the workflow is EXACTLY `running`. That is the
  first line of the method, not a later check, because a paused workflow that
  still dispatches is the worst defect this design can have.

  advance() is idempotent. It is called after every task state change and
  again on rehydrate, so calling it twice must dispatch once. The guarantee is
  structural, not defensive: `pending → ready → dispatched` is the only path
  to a provider call, every step of it goes through Task.transition() and the
  store, and a `dispatched` task is no longer `ready`.

No task may create tasks. `create()` is the only writer of `tasks` rows here,
and nothing reachable from a provider reaches it — which is the only reason
the bounds below mean anything at all.

          * `dispatched` with NO session never started — the provider call did

            `failed`: charging an attempt for work that never ran would spend
            the retry budget on nothing.
          * a session that came back is still live and may still report.
            Leaving it alone is the point; re-dispatching would duplicate work
            genuinely in flight.
          * a session that did NOT come back can never report again, so the
            task would sit `running` forever waiting for an event that cannot
            arrive. It fails with a reason that names the RESTART, because
            "the agent failed" sends the user looking at the task instead.

            declared and side-effect-free by construction, so re-running them
            is safe — and it is the only way to learn the verdict. Assuming
