"""SessionService (spec §5.1) — the seam where the existing voice tools meet
the Yuri domain. Every handler in tools.py that touches a session goes through
here, so mission/session/approval rows and events happen as a side effect of
flows that already exist. Provider calls are forwarded unchanged in shape.

WHY the odd-looking bits:

* `resolve()` accepts four ref forms (Yuri id, native handle, unique handle
  prefix, case-insensitive name) because the voice model habitually passes
  whichever it last heard — usually the *name*. An unresolvable ref raises
  KeyError listing the active names so tools.py can turn it into a soft error
  the model recovers from; an *ambiguous* prefix OR name also raises rather
  than silently picking a session, because picking the wrong one sends a
  message to the wrong agent.
* Names are de-duped on every path that puts a row INTO the live set — a new
  session (`_pick_name`), a revived `lost` row and a rehydrated insert (both
  `_dedupe_name`). `_pick_name` only knows about rows that are live *right
  now*, so a name it handed out can collide with one held by a row that later
  comes back; without the de-dupe two live rows share a name and resolve(name)
  silently picks whichever the store returns first.
* Events are emitted by exactly one path. A provider whose
  `capabilities().supports_events` is True already streams turn/question/error
  signals through the observer (`on_provider_event`), so `poll()` updates rows
  and mission state for such a provider but does NOT re-emit them — otherwise
  every turn would be recorded twice. Approvals are safe on both paths because
  `ApprovalService.record_request` dedups on `request_id`.
* `stop()` pauses the mission; it never completes it. Closing a session is not
  evidence the work succeeded (spec §38: never report unverified success).
* `set_mode()` snapshots the pending prompt BEFORE switching, because the
  runner resolves a now-covered prompt asynchronously — reading it afterwards
  races with that resolution.
