"""Who narrates which fact, and what each mode speaks.

Yuri has THREE ways the user learns something happened: the per-session poll
result the frontend already drains, the domain event stream, and the result of a
voice tool she just called (which she speaks). The first two both carry facts
that are ALSO marked speakable in domain/event.py's DEFAULTS — so without a
declared split she says everything twice. This module is that declaration.

Poll owns the session-turn events because its result is the only carrier that
sees EVERY sub-question of a multi-question AskUserQuestion (the tmux runner
notifies only from its hook path — see docs/yuri/follow-ups.md). The stream owns
mission-level state, which poll cannot see at all.

ONE OWNER PER FACT, NOT PER EVENT TYPE
--------------------------------------
The NARRATION_OWNER table below is necessary but NOT sufficient. The invariant
we actually want is "the user hears each fact once", and per-type ownership is
strictly weaker than that: two different event types can carry the same fact.
Two counterexamples were confirmed on this branch —

  one agent error   poll:   'Fake Agent hit an error: tmux pane died.'
                  + stream: '"billing" failed: tmux pane died.'
                    (`_fail_if_alone` turns the error into a mission failure
                     carrying the SAME reason string)

  pause_mission     tool:   'Mission "payments" is now paused.'
                  + stream: '"payments" is paused.'
                    (the tool result Yuri speaks is itself a carrier)

— so a mission event is narrated only when it is the FIRST carrier of its fact.
The payload's origin field decides that, and it is the only input needed:

  by == "voice"    The user commanded the change; the voice tool's own result is
                   spoken in the same breath and IS the report. Saying it again
                   is telling the user what they just did — verbatim the
                   rationale the `none` bucket already rests on.
  by == "system"   NOT sufficient on its own — `by` says who, not whether
                   anyone else already said it. There are exactly TWO producers
                   of a system transition, and they differ:

                     1. `SessionService._mission_to` — every transition it makes
                        RESTATES a session-level event poll owns and has already
                        spoken: failed ← agent.error (same `reason` string),
                        paused ← the session the user just closed,
                        waiting_for_approval ← the approval request, running ←
                        a completed turn (no line exists). Nothing is lost by
                        staying silent: poll is the reliable carrier for those
                        facts — every provider surfaces an error through
                        `poll_status` whether or not it streams events — which
                        is why poll owns them in the first place.
                     2. `SessionService.start`'s provider-failure path
                        (sessions.py, the `except` around `create_session`) —
                        ORIGINAL news. No session row was ever inserted, so no
                        poll can ever happen; the `agent.error` published beside
                        it is poll-owned, so `line_for` returns None for it on
                        the stream; and `start_session`'s exception is neither
                        ValueError nor KeyError, so main.py hands the voice
                        model only the generic "the tool failed unexpectedly".
                        If this event is silent, a mission failing to start is
                        narrated by NOBODY.

                   So the marker, not the origin, decides: `set_status`'s
                   `derived=True` (passed only by `_mission_to`) means "this
                   restates something already delivered". A system transition
                   with no marker is spoken.
  anything else    News. "ui" and "api" mean someone clicked a button or called
                   the API, and no spoken line covered it. Unknown origins, and
                   a system change with no `derived` marker, deliberately fail
                   OPEN (spoken): a rare repeat beats a silently swallowed line,
                   the same trade the frontend's spoken gate makes on a frame
                   with no id.

If you add a new mission transition, the question to answer is not "what is
`by`" but "does any other carrier already tell the user this fact". Only pass
`derived=True` when the answer is yes, and name the carrier in a comment.

`mission.created` is judged the same way but on `created_by`, and suppresses
ONLY "voice": a mission that Yuri or a script creates unprompted IS news, and
"handoff" is news with a different verb — `adopt()` picks up a session that was
already running, so asserting it is "starting" is the honesty class spec §5.2
forbids (see narration/service.py).
