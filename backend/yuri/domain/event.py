"""YuriEvent — the normalized event every subsystem emits (spec §11).

`severity` IS load-bearing: narration/policy.py's `speaks()` reads it to decide
what quiet mode still says out loud (warnings and errors get through).

`speakable` is NOT read by the narration layer. It survived as the design's
first sketch of "would we ever say this", and the DEFAULTS below are what
narration/policy.py's ownership table was derived FROM — but the table is the
authority now, and it is finer-grained (it also names the carrier, and the
mode). Treat `speakable` as a persisted hint for consumers of /yuri/events, not
as a narration switch."""
