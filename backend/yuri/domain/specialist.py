"""Specialist — a named agent (spec §5).

An "agent" used to mean a provider binary: `AgentRegistry` maps agent_id to
AgentProvider, and that was the whole model. A Specialist is the thing the
user actually creates and names — a role, a job description, a toolset, and
the provider that runs it.

Yuri's own persona is untouched by this. She is still the only voice and the
only personality the user talks to; a specialist's "persona" is a job
description handed to a provider, not a character. See
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-yuri-phase-7-design.md §3, which records
why the design README's "agents are providers, not personas" was reversed.
