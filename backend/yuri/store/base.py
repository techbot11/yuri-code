"""Repository interfaces (spec §4.4). Kept as ABCs so Postgres can replace
SQLite later without touching services.

Every method is sync and is called INLINE, on whatever thread the caller is
already on — including from async service methods and from the tmux runner's
sync observer callbacks. That is a recorded decision, not an oversight: the
store is a local SQLite file in WAL mode, so a read or a write is sub-
millisecond, and hopping to a thread per call would cost more than it saves
while making the services' ordering harder to reason about. The one exception
is the event writer (`EventBus._write_loop`), which persists via
`asyncio.to_thread` because it is a background fan-out, not a caller waiting on
a result. A future Postgres implementation, whose calls cross a network, would
have to revisit this.

`SqliteStore` keeps one connection per thread (threading.local), so inline
calls from threadpool workers are safe."""
