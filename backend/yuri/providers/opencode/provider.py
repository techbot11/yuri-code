"""OpenCode as an AgentProvider — the second real implementation of the
contract, and therefore the first evidence that the abstraction is one.

`client.py` owns the envelope, the auth header and the error translation;
`server.py` owns attach-or-spawn and the never-stop-what-you-didn't-start
rule. What is left here reads as contract methods plus one piece of real
design: the cursor.

## The cursor

Per handle the provider remembers the highest `durable.seq` it has actually
consumed from `GET /history?after=N`. Two properties follow, both tested:

  * **A completed turn is reported exactly once.** The cursor advances only
    past events that were genuinely returned, so a second `poll()` sees an
    empty page — the bug the tmux backend needs a `_pending_results` FIFO to
    avoid, avoided here by the server's own sequence numbers.
  * **An event type nobody has mapped is ignored, not fatal.** A successful
    turn's event vocabulary was never captured during the live probe (design
    spec section 2.1), so completion is read from an assistant message's
    `finish` field — never from an event type we have not observed — and an
    unrecognised type advances the cursor without raising. The failure mode is
    silence, which the live check closes, rather than a wrong claim.

`/message` has no cursor of its own, so the handle carries a second
high-water mark (`msg_seen`): the number of message entries already reported.
Without it the *previous* turn's finished assistant message would be found the
instant the next turn's first event arrived and reported as that turn's reply.

## Asks outrank history, and must not consume it

A pending permission or question is read on every `poll` and reported ahead of
anything in history: a blocked turn has to surface the ask, because the user
is the only thing that can unblock it. The early return therefore leaves
**both** marks exactly where they were, so a completion or a failure sitting
behind the ask is *deferred*, not swallowed — the next poll after the ask
clears reports it, exactly once, from the same unmoved marks.

`answer` maps a decision onto OpenCode's reply endpoints under one rule that
is not negotiable: **allow → `once`, deny → `reject`, and `always` is never
sent for any phrasing.** `decide_permission` answers a single question;
`always` would turn one spoken "yes" into a standing grant the user never
agreed to, and granting standing permission is a mode change OpenCode does not
even expose. Anything `decide_permission` cannot read cleanly raises a
`ValueError` and reaches OpenCode not at all.

## The sync/async bridge — the one real design choice

`send_message`, `answer`, `poll`, `list_native`, `run_slash` and `backend_of`
are synchronous by contract (the voice model polls; awaiting a turn would
stall speech for minutes), but every OpenCode operation is async HTTP. Of the
two available mechanisms this uses **(a): the provider owns one background
thread running its own event loop**, and every method — sync *and* async —
submits its coroutine there with `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`. Sync
callers block on the returned `concurrent.futures.Future`; async callers
`await asyncio.wrap_future(...)`.

Why (a) and not a bridge onto the caller's running loop: Yuri's sync provider
methods are called *from inside* her event loop (`tools.py` → `SessionService`
→ `provider.poll`), and `run_coroutine_threadsafe(...).result()` onto that
same loop would deadlock — the thread that must run the coroutine is the
thread blocked waiting for it. (`asyncio.run()` is worse still: it raises
outright inside a running loop.) A separate loop also keeps every
`httpx.AsyncClient` and every `asyncio.Lock` in `server.py` bound to exactly
one loop for the provider's whole life, which is what those objects require;
splitting the async methods onto the caller's loop would use a pooled HTTP
client from two loops at once.

The thread is created lazily on first use — constructing a provider that is
never used costs nothing, which matters because `build_container` constructs
every configured provider at startup — and `shutdown()` cancels whatever is
left on it, stops the loop, **joins the thread** and closes the loop, so a
suite run leaks no threads, loops or warnings. It is a daemon thread purely as
a backstop against a caller who forgets to call `shutdown()`.

`send_message` stays effectively non-blocking because `POST …/prompt` is:
it returns `admittedSeq` immediately rather than awaiting the turn. `poll`
issues its two reads (history, and messages only while a turn is in flight)
concurrently on the provider's loop, so it costs one round trip, not two.

The honest cost of a synchronous contract: a sync method blocks the *caller's*
thread — Yuri's event loop — for that round trip, where `ClaudeCodeProvider`'s
equivalent is a pure in-memory read. Local, that is a millisecond or two. The
worst case is bounded by the HTTP client's own 30s timeout (CALL_TIMEOUT_S is
only the backstop above it), so a hung OpenCode stalls the loop rather than
losing work. Removing that entirely means an async `poll` in `base.py`, which
is a contract change for every provider and nobody's to make here.

        --mini, never the root TUI WITH it. `attach --session` really does land

        Sessions are global in OpenCode's store, not scoped to a directory

        so the `cd` here is only so the TUI opens on the right project.

        OpenCode sessions outlive her — they are the server's, not the
        process's — so unlike an SDK session they can be picked back up. Two
        rules govern that, and both are the point of this method:

        **1. A session the server has and Yuri has no row for is left alone.**
        `known` is what she has rows for; anything else on that server may be
        the user's own OpenCode work, and adopting it would put her in charge
        of something she was never asked to run — the same instinct as never
        stopping a server she did not start. So this iterates the server's
        list and keeps only the intersection, and a caller with nothing known
        does not even reach the network.

        **2. Both marks come back with the session, or she re-narrates.**
        `cursor` makes events exactly-once and `msg_seen` makes completions
        exactly-once; a handle restored with `msg_seen = 0` reports the reply
        the user already heard as the *next* turn's completion. See
        `_restored_mark` for what a missing or impossible mark restores to.

        `pending` is deliberately not restored. OpenCode owns the pending
        list, so the first poll re-derives any unanswered ask from the server;
        a remembered request id could outlive the request it names.

        An unreachable server logs and returns nothing rather than raising: a
        dead OpenCode must not break Yuri's startup (design spec section 41).
