"""AgentProvider — the contract every coding-agent backend implements.

Shaped to what the existing runners actually do: `send_message`/`answer` are
NON-BLOCKING (they kick off a turn and return) and `poll` returns the runner's
result dict — the voice model depends on "returns working instantly, poll later"
(see frontend/lib/operating.ts). Awaiting a turn to completion here would stall
the voice for minutes.
