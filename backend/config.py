"""Backend runtime configuration.

Single place where environment-driven settings are resolved: each setting reads
its environment variable when present, otherwise falls back to the default
defined here. The `.env` files are loaded first so values placed there are
honored regardless of which module imports config first.

Config location:

  * backend/.env  — the SINGLE source of truth for a clone (gitignored). The
                    setup wizard writes it, `yapcode config` edits it, and the
                    backend loads it directly — so the wizard's key works no
                    matter how the backend is started (run.sh, bare uvicorn,
                    launcher).
  * ~/.config/yapcode/.env — used ONLY by a read-only install (Homebrew), whose
                    wrapper sets YAPCODE_CONFIG_DIR because the Cellar can't host
                    a writable backend/.env. A normal clone never consults it.
  * $YURI_HOME/config/.env — where PUT /yuri/config (setup_store.write) puts
                    what the Setup UI saves. Consulted UNCONDITIONALLY (unlike
                    the Homebrew path above, gated on YAPCODE_CONFIG_DIR),
                    because a plain clone never sets that variable: without
                    this, a value saved from Setup would sit in a file nothing
                    ever reads back, invisible again the moment the process
                    restarts.

VC_AUTH_TOKEN is never auto-loaded from any of these — it is opt-in per run mode
(loopback-only `yapcode up`/run.sh stay tokenless; run-network.sh exports it
explicitly). See the access-control note below.

#      Bearer` / `?token=`). When UNSET, only loopback (localhost) clients are
#      allowed and any remote caller is refused — so plain `run.sh` on localhost
#      needs zero config, while exposing the server to the LAN (run-network.sh)
#      forces a token to be set first. The token is required even from loopback
#      once configured, so the same-origin Next proxy can't be used to launder a
#      remote attacker's request into a trusted loopback call.
