"""The project-directory sandbox, plus the process's one ClaudeCodeProvider.

What is left here after Phase 3:

* `resolve_project_path` / `list_projects` — the MANDATORY directory sandbox
  every session start goes through. `ProjectService` calls them, so this is the
  single place the allowed-roots rule is implemented (spec §5.2).
* `provider()` / `set_provider()` / `reset()` — the "exactly one
  ClaudeCodeProvider per process" guard. `yuri.app.build_container` installs
  the registry's instance here on startup and `yuri.app.shutdown` clears it;
  two live TmuxClaudeRunners would compete over the same tmux control dirs and
  both rehydrate the same panes.

Everything else that used to live here is GONE. Session lookup, naming, modes,
peeking, closing, rehydration and terminal handoff are owned by
`yuri.services.sessions.SessionService`, which routes per-handle through the
provider — there is no `_runners` map, no `runner_for()` routing and no
`_names` dict any more. Reach for `container().sessions`, not this module.
