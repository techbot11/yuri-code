**yapcode is one voice agent for all your [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
sessions.** It becomes Claude's **mouth and ears**: you speak, and it drives **real** Claude
Code sessions on your machine via `tmux` — starting them across your projects, sending
instructions, approving permission prompts, running slash commands, and narrating the results
back. A live terminal streams the actual Claude TUI to your browser and your phone, so you can
watch (and take over by keyboard) at any time.

### What it does

- 🎙️ **Hands-free Claude Code** — speak; the agent drives a real `claude` session and reads the answer back.
- 🖥️ **Live terminal, anywhere** — the Claude TUI streams to browser and phone via xterm.js; watch it work or grab the keyboard.
- 🔀 **OpenAI Realtime or Gemini Live** — pick your voice model (OpenAI direct or via Azure; Gemini has a free tier). Keys stay server-side.
- 📱 **Code from mobile (on your local network, for now)** — talk to Claude and watch the live terminal from anywhere in the house. Setup: [use it from your phone](#use-it-from-your-phone-local-network).
- ✅ **Approve by voice** — say *"yes"*, *"allow"*, or *"switch to auto mode"* without touching the keyboard.
- 🤝 **Co-drive** — voice and keyboard share one `tmux` session; type and talk on the same session simultaneously.
- 🔁 **Hand off in either direction** — `/voice-handoff` continues a terminal session by voice; the printed `tmux attach` takes the keyboard on a voice one. Details: [co-driving](#co-driving-voice--keyboard-on-one-session).
- 🖥️ **Control the real TUI via voice** — *"run /init"* · *"interrupt that"* · *"what's on the screen?"*
- 🗂️ **Juggle projects** — list, start, rename, and close sessions across your allowed folders, by name, entirely by voice.

> [!WARNING]
> **The backend executes real commands on your computer** — it drives `claude`, which runs
> shell commands, edits files, and approves tool calls on your behalf. Read
> **[Security model (read this first)](#security-model-read-this-first)** before you expose it
> beyond `localhost`.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

`yapcode up` checks these and tells you what's missing ([full list](#prerequisites-1)):

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), installed and logged in
- Voice API key — Gemini ([free tier](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)), OpenAI native, or OpenAI via Azure
- tmux
- Python 3.12+
- Node 20+

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nithiink/yapcode.git
cd yapcode
./bin/yapcode up    # first run: setup wizard → installs deps → opens http://localhost:3000
```

**Don't want to install the prerequisites yourself?** Use [Homebrew](#install-with-homebrew) —
`brew` pulls in `tmux`, `python@3.12`, and `node` for you:

```sh
brew tap nithiink/yapcode
brew trust nithiink/yapcode   # one-time: newer brew gates third-party taps until trusted
brew install yapcode
yapcode up    # same wizard; opens http://localhost:3000
```

The [first-run wizard](#first-run-setup-wizard) asks for a voice key and the folder(s) the
agent may edit; after that, `yapcode up` just launches.

## How it works

```
  you ──speak──▶  Voice agent          (OpenAI / Azure, or Gemini Live)
                    │  tool calls
                    ▼
                 Backend  (FastAPI, :8000)
                    │  tmux send-keys / capture-pane
                    ▼
                 Claude Code CLI  (real `claude` session in a tmux pane)
                    │
                    ▼
  browser/phone ◀── live xterm.js terminal  (Next.js frontend, :3000)
```

- **Backend (`backend/`)** — FastAPI. Mints short-lived voice-provider tokens (your provider
  keys stay server-side; the browser only ever gets an ephemeral token) and turns the voice
  agent's tool calls into real actions against Claude Code via tmux.
- **Frontend (`frontend/`)** — Next.js 16 / React 19. The browser UI, the realtime audio
  transports, and the live xterm.js terminal that streams the Claude TUI.
- Each session runs in a tmux session named `vc_<id>`, so the voice agent, the browser
  terminal, and your own keyboard can all drive the same Claude session at once.

The code-level path through this pipeline is in
[Architecture (for contributors)](#architecture-for-contributors).

## Security model (read this first)

yapcode runs a backend that **executes commands on your machine**. It has two independent
layers of defense — both **fail-closed**.

| Layer | Control | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Authentication** | `VC_AUTH_TOKEN` | A shared secret that gates every sensitive endpoint and the live-terminal WebSocket. **If set**, it is required from *every* caller — including loopback (`loopback` = connections from your own machine: `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`). **If unset**, only loopback clients are allowed and all remote callers are refused. Network mode (`run-network.sh`, binding `0.0.0.0`) **refuses to start without a token**. |
| **2. Directory sandbox** | `ALLOWED_PROJECT_ROOTS` | A **mandatory** allowlist of directories Claude sessions may **start** in. If unset, `start_session` refuses — sessions cannot be started anywhere on the filesystem. Paths are `realpath`-resolved and containment-checked, so `..`, symlinks, and absolute-path escapes are blocked. |

In plain language:

- **On `localhost`, it just works** with zero config — the backend trusts loopback (your own
  machine: `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`), so no token is needed.
- **The moment you go off your laptop** (LAN, phone, tunnel), you *must* set a token, and
  the network launcher will not start without one.
- **Sessions only start inside folders you allowlist** (`ALLOWED_PROJECT_ROOTS`), and the
  voice agent itself can't run arbitrary commands — its only tools spawn and drive Claude
  sessions. What Claude does *inside* a session is governed by Claude Code's own permission
  model: in default mode it asks first and you approve or deny (by voice or keyboard); auto
  mode acts without asking, exactly like at the keyboard.

Full details — the `_access_ok` check, Origin allowlist, CSRF defenses, log redaction — are in
[Security & access control (details)](#security--access-control-details) below.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **OS** | macOS or Linux. Windows must use **[WSL2](#windows-wsl2)** (yapcode drives Claude Code through tmux, which is Unix-only). |
| **tmux** | On `PATH`. |
| **Python 3.12+** | An older default `python3` fails with a *misleading* `No matching distribution found for claude-agent-sdk` error. |
| **Node 20+** | For the frontend. |
| **Git** | To clone (for the from-source path). |
| **Claude Code** | Installed and **logged in** separately: [claude.com/claude-code](https://claude.com/claude-code), or `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` then run `claude` once to sign in. Uses your existing subscription — no Anthropic API key. Homebrew cannot install or log you into it. |
| **A voice provider key** | OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or Google Gemini. **Gemini has a free API tier** ([aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)). |

```sh
# macOS — installs everything except Claude Code itself
brew install tmux node python@3.12 git
```

On **Debian / Ubuntu**, apt covers tmux/Python/git, but its Node is usually too old — install
Node 20+ via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (as shown in the [WSL2 section](#windows-wsl2)),
not from apt. Use Ubuntu 24.04+ for Python 3.12.

```sh
# Debian / Ubuntu — Python/tmux/git only (install Node 20+ separately via nvm)
sudo apt install tmux git python3 python3-venv
```

---

## Install from source

This is the primary path — `git clone`, then `./bin/yapcode up`. The commands are in the
[quickstart](#quickstart); the details unique to a clone:

- On first `up` the launcher **bootstraps dependencies**: if `backend/.venv` is missing it picks
  a Python 3.12+ interpreter and `pip install`s `backend/requirements.txt`; if
  `frontend/node_modules` is missing it runs `npm ci`. (It does **not** install `tmux`, Python,
  or Node — those are prerequisites; use [Homebrew](#install-with-homebrew) if you'd rather not
  install them yourself.)
- It then preflights ports 8000/3000, starts both servers, polls for readiness (~60s), prints
  `yapcode is running — http://localhost:3000`, and opens it.
- `./bin/yapcode config` and `./bin/yapcode session` work from a clone too.

### Manual / dev setup

Use this if you want full control of each piece (and for contributing — see
[Contributing](#contributing)).

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv                       # MUST be Python 3.12+ (see Troubleshooting)
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env                         # then edit: at minimum a voice provider key
                                             #   and ALLOWED_PROJECT_ROOTS

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm ci
```

`ALLOWED_PROJECT_ROOTS` and a voice provider key are the minimum required config. `tmux` must be
on your `PATH`. On macOS, if your default `python3` is older than 3.12:

```bash
brew install python@3.12
# then create the venv with python3.12 -m venv .venv
```

> **One writable config file.** In a clone it is `~/Yuri/config/.env` (`$YURI_HOME/config/.env`)
> — the wizard writes it, `yapcode config` edits it, and Yuri OS's own **Setup** screen saves to
> it, so all three routes reach the same file. (Only a Homebrew install differs: its read-only
> Cellar can't hold a writable in-tree file, so the wrapper sets `YAPCODE_CONFIG_DIR` and the
> file lives at `~/.config/yapcode/.env` instead. You can set that same variable in a clone if
> you'd rather keep config elsewhere.) The backend also still loads a pre-existing
> `backend/.env`, **last** and so lowest-precedence; nothing writes it any more, and the wizard
> copies one it finds into the writable location on first run.

### First-run setup wizard

The first time you run any subcommand (`up` / `session` / `config`) with no config present, a
wizard runs and writes the config file (created `0600`, `umask 077`) — `~/Yuri/config/.env` from
a clone, or `~/.config/yapcode/.env` on a Homebrew install. It prompts for:

1. **Gemini API key** — optional (free tier at <https://aistudio.google.com/apikey>), Enter to skip.
2. **OpenAI key** (`sk-...`) — optional, Enter to skip.
3. **Folder(s) the agent may edit** — comma-separated; a leading `~` is expanded. At least one
   is required; each must exist and may **not** be empty, `/`, or your `$HOME` (rejected as too
   broad).

The wizard derives the default `VOICE_PROVIDER` (Gemini key → `gemini`; else OpenAI key →
`openai`; else `openai` placeholder with a warning to add a key later) and **auto-generates a
`VC_AUTH_TOKEN`** for later network/phone use. **Azure OpenAI is config-file-only** (not
prompted) — add it later with `yapcode config`.

Only the *absence* of the config file triggers the wizard; later runs never re-prompt. To change
anything, edit the file or run `yapcode config`.

### CLI subcommands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `yapcode up` *(default)* | Runs the wizard if needed, bootstraps deps, starts backend (`:8000`) + frontend (`:3000`), opens the app. Ctrl-C stops both. |
| `yapcode session [dir]` | Starts and attaches a voice-ready Claude session in `dir`. |
| `yapcode config` | Opens the config file (`~/Yuri/config/.env`, or `~/.config/yapcode/.env` on Homebrew) in `$EDITOR` (falls back to `open`). Same file the app's Setup screen writes. |

`yapcode -h` / `--help` prints `usage: yapcode {up|session [dir]|config}`. An unknown
subcommand prints usage to stderr and exits `2`.

### As a desktop app

    yuri app

Opens Yuri in her own window — no terminal, no browser tab. She keeps running
when you close the window: the tray icon shows what she is doing, and only
Quit stops her.

This runs the same two servers `yuri up` does, so the two cannot run at once.
It is not yet a `.dmg` you can hand to someone else — it uses this clone's
`backend/.venv` and needs `claude` and `tmux` installed as usual. Packaging
comes next.

### Installing the app

    cd frontend && npx next build
    python3 desktop/scripts/build-python.py
    npm --prefix desktop run dist

Puts `Yuri OS-0.1.0-arm64.dmg` in `desktop/dist/`. The app ships its own
Python, so it does not need this clone's `backend/.venv` — but it still needs
`claude` and `tmux` on your `PATH`, and it uses your own `claude`, not a
bundled copy, so both backends run the same version.

It is **unsigned**, so the first open needs right-click → Open rather than a
double-click. Two consequences worth knowing: macOS asks for the microphone
again after every rebuild (the grant is tied to the bundle, and an unsigned
one changes identity when it is replaced), and API keys you save in the app
go to your login Keychain rather than to a file.

---

## Install with Homebrew

**Prefer not to install the prerequisites yourself?** `brew install` pulls in `tmux`,
`python@3.12`, and `node` and builds the app — handy on a fresh machine. Works on macOS and
Linuxbrew:

```sh
brew tap nithiink/yapcode
brew trust nithiink/yapcode   # one-time; see note below
brew install yapcode          # pulls in tmux, python@3.12, node; builds the app
yapcode up                    # first run: setup wizard → starts servers → opens browser
```

> **Why `brew trust`?** Newer Homebrew refuses to install from *any* third-party tap (anything
> outside homebrew/core) until you trust it once — supply-chain protection, not a warning about
> this tap specifically. If your brew is older and doesn't have `brew trust`, skip that line.

Details unique to Homebrew:

- The formula `depends_on` node, python@3.12, and tmux, copies the source into the **Cellar**,
  builds the backend virtualenv and a **production** frontend build (so the launcher runs
  `next start`, with no compile-on-launch), and puts `yapcode` on your `PATH`.
- Your config (`~/.config/yapcode/.env`) and runtime state (`~/.local/state/yapcode/`) live
  **outside** the install and **survive `brew upgrade` and uninstall**.

```bash
brew upgrade yapcode    # later, to update
```

---

## Running

> Using the launcher? `yapcode up` already handles localhost running — this section is the
> manual equivalent, useful for development. **Network mode applies to everyone.**

### Localhost (zero-config, trusted loopback)

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend on http://localhost:8000
cd backend && ./run.sh

# Terminal 2 — frontend on http://localhost:3000
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

On localhost the backend trusts loopback (your own machine: `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`), so
**no auth token is needed**. The backend never auto-loads `VC_AUTH_TOKEN` from a `.env` file — it's
opt-in per run mode, so `run.sh` (and `yapcode up`) stay zero-config even with a token in your
config; it applies only when `run-network.sh` exports it. Open <http://localhost:3000>.

### LAN / phone (network mode, TLS + token required)

Network mode binds `0.0.0.0` over HTTPS/WSS and **fails closed without a `VC_AUTH_TOKEN`**.

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend over TLS on https://0.0.0.0:8000 (needs VC_AUTH_TOKEN in your config file)
cd backend && ./run-network.sh

# Terminal 2 — frontend over TLS on https://0.0.0.0:3000
cd frontend && npm run dev:network
```

One-time per device:

1. **Generate dev TLS certs** at `frontend/.certs/dev-key.pem` and `dev-cert.pem`. The cert's
   SANs must include the device's IP. Copy the template and set your LAN IP under `[alt]`,
   then:

   ```bash
   cd frontend/.certs
   cp san.cnf.example san.cnf      # then edit: set IP.1 to your LAN IP
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 825 \
     -keyout dev-key.pem -out dev-cert.pem -config san.cnf
   ```

   Re-run this whenever your LAN IP changes.
2. Visit `https://<host>:8000` once and **accept the self-signed cert** — otherwise the `wss`
   terminal connection is silently blocked.
3. Open the app once as `https://<host>:3000/#vc_token=<VC_AUTH_TOKEN>`. The browser stores the
   token in `localStorage` and strips it from the URL. (The token is never baked into the JS
   bundle.)

A phone needs HTTPS (a "secure context") for the microphone to work off localhost.

If you ran the [first-run wizard](#first-run-setup-wizard), **a `VC_AUTH_TOKEN` was already
generated for you** — it's in your config file (`yapcode config` to view). Manual setups
can generate one with:

```bash
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

---

## Use it from your phone (local network)

The full experience — talk to Claude **and watch the live terminal** — from your phone, as long
as it's on the same Wi-Fi as your computer. The work always happens on your machine; the phone
is just a remote.

**On your computer (once):**

1. Start [network mode](#lan--phone-network-mode-tls--token-required) — both servers over TLS,
   with the cert's SAN matching your LAN IP.
2. Find your LAN IP: `ipconfig getifaddr en0` (macOS) or `hostname -I` (Linux) — say it's
   `192.168.1.42`.
3. Have your `VC_AUTH_TOKEN` handy — the wizard already wrote one to your config file
   (`yapcode config` to view).

**On your phone (once per device):**

1. Join the **same Wi-Fi** as your computer.
2. Open `https://192.168.1.42:8000` and **accept the self-signed certificate**. Skip this and
   the live terminal is *silently* blocked (the `wss:` connection fails without any visible
   error).
3. Open `https://192.168.1.42:3000/#vc_token=<your token>` — the app stores the token and strips
   it from the address bar. Allow **microphone** access when prompted.

   > 💡 You don't have to type this URL: `npm run dev:network` **prints the full
   > phone URL** (IP + token) at startup — just open it on your phone.

**Every time after that:** just open `https://192.168.1.42:3000` — talk, watch the terminal,
approve permission prompts from the couch, the kitchen, anywhere on the network.

If something doesn't work:

- **Mic button does nothing** → you opened `http://` or used a hostname not in the cert — the
  mic needs a secure context (`https://`).
- **Terminal stays blank** → re-visit `https://<ip>:8000` and accept the cert again.
- **Nothing loads after a router change** → your LAN IP changed; regenerate the certs with the
  new IP (see [network mode](#lan--phone-network-mode-tls--token-required)) and re-accept on the
  phone.

---

## Windows (WSL2)

There is **no native Windows support** — yapcode drives Claude Code through tmux, which is
Unix-only. The supported path is WSL2.

```powershell
# 1. In PowerShell (Administrator), then reboot and set a Linux username/password:
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
```

> Use **Ubuntu 24.04** — it ships Python 3.12. Ubuntu 22.04 ships 3.10 and 20.04 ships 3.8,
> both too old (you'll hit the misleading `claude-agent-sdk` pip error).

```bash
# 2. Inside Ubuntu — system deps:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y tmux git python3 python3-venv curl

# 3. Node 20+ via nvm:
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
exec $SHELL
nvm install 20

# 4. Install Claude Code inside WSL and run `claude` once to sign in.

# 5. Clone into the LINUX home (NOT /mnt/c/...) and start:
git clone https://github.com/nithiink/yapcode.git ~/yapcode
cd ~/yapcode
./bin/yapcode up
```

Then open **<http://localhost:3000>** in your Windows browser (WSL2 forwards localhost, and the
mic only works in that secure context — don't use a LAN IP).

WSL gotchas:

- **Clone into the Linux home** (e.g. `~/yapcode`), not `/mnt/c/...` — the latter is slow and
  breaks file watching.
- Set `ALLOWED_PROJECT_ROOTS` to a **Linux path** (e.g. `/home/<you>/projects`) and keep edited
  projects on the Linux side.

## Configuration reference

Config lives at **`~/Yuri/config/.env`** (`$YURI_HOME/config/.env`, chmod `600`) — the one
writable file, shared by the wizard, `yapcode config` and the app's **Setup** screen. A
**Homebrew** install instead uses **`~/.config/yapcode/.env`** (its wrapper sets
`YAPCODE_CONFIG_DIR`, since the Cellar is read-only); set `YAPCODE_CONFIG_DIR` yourself to keep a
clone's config elsewhere. The backend reads, in precedence order: the real process environment,
then `$YAPCODE_CONFIG_DIR/.env` (Homebrew only), then `$YURI_HOME/config/.env`, then a
pre-existing `backend/.env` **last** — each file only filling what the ones before it left unset.
Nothing writes `backend/.env` any more; the wizard copies one it finds into the writable location.
Runtime state (logs, tmux store) lives under `<project>/.yapcode/` from a clone, or
**`~/.local/state/yapcode`** on Homebrew (override base via `XDG_STATE_HOME` / `VC_SESSION_STORE`);
the Homebrew config + state survive `brew upgrade` and uninstall.

The [first-run wizard](#first-run-setup-wizard) writes this file; `yapcode config` edits it.

### Core

| Variable | Required | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ALLOWED_PROJECT_ROOTS` | **Yes** | — | Comma-separated dirs the agent may start sessions in. **Mandatory sandbox** — if unset, `start_session` refuses (fail closed). |
| `VC_AUTH_TOKEN` | Network mode | _(empty)_ | Shared secret. If **set**, required from every caller incl. loopback; if **unset**, only loopback is allowed and remote is refused. Auto-generated by the wizard. |
| `VOICE_PROVIDER` | Yes | `azure` | `azure` \| `openai` \| `gemini`. Also toggleable in the UI. |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | No | `opus` | `opus` or `sonnet`. |

### Voice providers (keys stay server-side)

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | OpenAI provider key. |
| `OPENAI_REALTIME_MODEL` | `gpt-realtime-mini` | OpenAI realtime model. |
| `REALTIME_VOICE` | `marin` | OpenAI/Azure realtime voice. |

### Origins, state & advanced

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VC_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | empty | Extra exact cross-origin browser origins (comma-separated). |
| `VC_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEX` | _(LAN regex)_ | Overrides the default private-LAN origin regex (localhost/127.0.0.1/::1 + 10.x/192.168.x/172.16–31.x); set empty to disable LAN origins. |
| `VC_SESSION_STORE` | `<repo>/.yapcode/tmux` | Session control-dir root (tmux sessions, `meta.json`, `events.jsonl`, …). |
| `VC_COST_LOG_PATH` | `<repo>/cost-log.jsonl` | Append-only cost log. |
| `VC_PRICING_JSON` | _(built-in rates)_ | JSON object overriding per-model list pricing, e.g. `{"opus":{"input":5,"output":25}}` (USD per 1M tokens, matched by model-id substring). The CLI backend has no dollar figure in its transcript (Max subscription), so the displayed "Claude $…" is reconstructed from per-message token usage × these rates; cache reads bill at 0.1× input, 5-min cache writes at 1.25×, 1-hour writes at 2×. |
| `VC_DEBUG_LOG_PATH` | `<repo>/debug-log.jsonl` | Append-only pipeline event log. |
| `VC_DEBUG_LOG_FILE` | `1` | Set `0` to keep debug events in-memory/SSE only (no file). |
| `VC_DEBUG_BUFFER` | `3000` | In-memory ring-buffer size for the event bus. |
| `VC_KILL_SESSIONS_ON_SHUTDOWN` | `0` | `1` kills CLI sessions on shutdown instead of detaching + rehydrating on restart. |
| `CLAUDE_CLI_CHROME` | _(on)_ | Set `0` to disable passing `--chrome` to the `claude` CLI. |
| `TOOL_TIMEOUT_S` | `600` | Tool-dispatch timeout (seconds). |

Frontend-side: `BACKEND_URL` (default `http://localhost:8000`) is what the Next `/api/*` proxy
forwards to; `dev:network` sets it to `https://localhost:8000` and `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`.

See [`backend/.env.example`](backend/.env.example) for the full annotated list of every variable.

> Under Homebrew, the launcher wrapper exports `YAPCODE_ROOT` (pins the install tree) and
> redirects runtime writes out of the read-only Cellar: `VC_SESSION_STORE` points at
> `~/.local/state/yapcode/tmux` (a subdirectory), while `VC_COST_LOG_PATH` and `VC_DEBUG_LOG_PATH`
> are files directly under `~/.local/state/yapcode`.

## Security & access control (details)

The two-layer model is summarized [up top](#security-model-read-this-first); this section adds the
code-level specifics. The security boundary is the **auth token**; the Origin allowlist is a
convenience for same-network devices, not the boundary.

### Layer 1 — authentication (`VC_AUTH_TOKEN`)

`_access_ok` in `backend/main.py` is the gate. A mismatch returns `401` (when a token is
configured) or `403` (when relying on loopback). Token comparison is **constant-time**
(`secrets.compare_digest`). Even loopback must present a configured token, so the same-origin Next
proxy can't launder a remote attacker's request into a "trusted" localhost call. The token is
never auto-loaded from a `.env` file (opt-in per run mode); `run-network.sh` reads it from the
config file and **exports** it, and **refuses to start** if none is set.

**Token transport.** `Authorization: Bearer`, `X-VC-Token` header, or `?token=` query param
(SSE/WebSocket can't set headers). The browser supplies it once via
`https://<host>:3000/#vc_token=<token>` (persisted to `localStorage`, stripped from the URL). It
is **never baked into the JS bundle**. The token is **redacted from access logs** (it rides the
query string on the SSE debug stream and the terminal WebSocket). The terminal WebSocket
authorizes Origin + token **before** `ws.accept()`; a disallowed Origin closes with `4403`, a
bad/missing token with `4401`.

### Layer 2 — directory sandbox (`ALLOWED_PROJECT_ROOTS`)

`ALLOWED_PROJECT_ROOTS` confines every session's **starting working directory**. Every
candidate path — including fuzzy-matched ones — is `realpath`-normalized and
containment-checked, so `..`, symlinks, and absolute-path escapes are blocked. The wizard also
rejects roots that are empty, `/`, `$HOME`, or non-existent.

Scope note: this bounds where sessions *start*, not what a running Claude session may touch —
actions inside a session are gated by Claude Code's own permission prompts (and act freely in
auto mode, as at the keyboard). The voice agent's own tool surface contains no
arbitrary-command tool: it can only spawn and drive Claude sessions.

### Additional hardening

- **CORS** is restricted to trusted frontend origins (no wildcard), and the Origin allowlist is
  enforced **in-app** (not just via CORS response headers) — a disallowed Origin gets `403` even
  though CORS would hide the response.
- The Next `/api/*` proxy rejects **cross-site** requests (via `Sec-Fetch-Site`, with Origin/Host
  fallback) to block drive-by CSRF. The frontend dev server binds loopback only (`-H 127.0.0.1`),
  so in zero-config localhost mode the proxy isn't reachable from the LAN; LAN access requires
  `npm run dev:network`.
- Interactive API docs (`/docs`, `/openapi.json`) are **disabled** so the route/schema map isn't
  disclosed.

> The Origin allowlist is a convenience for same-network devices — **the token is the security
> boundary.**

## Co-driving: voice + keyboard on one session

Because each session runs in a tmux session named `vc_<id>` and tmux allows multiple clients on
one pane, you can drive a single Claude session by **voice and keyboard at the same time** —
single process, single transcript, no conflicts.

The bridge is the **`/voice-handoff`** command (a skill shipped in the Claude Code plugin at
`integrations/claude-code-plugin/`). It registers the terminal session you're sitting in with
your local yapcode backend, so the voice agent can co-drive that exact session. Install the
plugin once (user scope, available in every session):

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add nithiink/yapcode
claude plugin install yapcode@yapcode
```

Then, with the backend running, either:

- **Start voice-ready (recommended):** run the plugin's `yapcode` launcher
  (`integrations/claude-code-plugin/bin/yapcode` — distinct from the top-level `yapcode` CLI)
  instead of plain `claude`. Work normally; type `/voice-handoff` whenever you want voice — it
  switches on instantly, no restart. Keep typing there, and open the app to talk.
- **From a plain `claude` session:** type `/voice-handoff`; yapcode reopens the session under
  voice management and prints a `tmux attach -t vc_…` command. Press **Ctrl-D** to leave the
  old process (single writer per session), then run the attach command to keep typing in the
  same session while the voice agent drives it too. Only want to drive by voice? Just open the
  app — no attach needed.

Reaching a **remote or tunneled backend** instead of localhost: set `YAPCODE_URL` (default
`http://localhost:8000`) and `YAPCODE_TOKEN` (required when the backend has `VC_AUTH_TOKEN`
set).

Both clients share one pane, so **take turns** — don't type and talk in the exact same instant.
More detail in the [plugin README](integrations/claude-code-plugin/README.md).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause & fix |
| --- | --- |
| `brew install` refuses: `Refusing to load formula … from untrusted tap` | Newer Homebrew gates **all third-party taps** until trusted once (supply-chain protection — not a warning about this tap specifically). Run `brew trust nithiink/yapcode`, then `brew install yapcode`. |
| `pip` fails: `No matching distribution found for claude-agent-sdk==…` | **Python is too old** — must be **3.12+**. macOS: `brew install python@3.12` and build the venv with `python3.12`. Ubuntu: upgrade to 24.04 (20.04 ships 3.8, 22.04 ships 3.10). |
| `start_session` refuses / "no allowed roots" | `ALLOWED_PROJECT_ROOTS` is unset — the sandbox fails closed by design. Set it to existing folders (not `/`, `$HOME`, or empty). |
| `run-network.sh` exits `1` immediately | Network mode **fails closed without `VC_AUTH_TOKEN`** in your config file (`~/Yuri/config/.env`). `yapcode up` generates one; otherwise set it by hand, then open the app once with `/#vc_token=<token>`. |
| `yapcode up` exits `1` on startup | **Port 8000 or 3000 is already in use.** Free the port and retry. |
| Live terminal connects but stays blank / silently fails (LAN/phone) | You skipped the one-time self-signed-cert accept at `https://<host>:8000`, so the `wss` terminal is blocked. Visit it once and accept. Also: an HTTPS page must use `wss` (no mixed content). |
| Mic doesn't work on phone | `getUserMedia` needs a secure context. Use `npm run dev:network` (HTTPS on `0.0.0.0`); plain `npm run dev` is HTTP + loopback-only. The device's IP must be in the cert SANs (`frontend/.certs/san.cnf`, copied from `san.cnf.example`); regenerate the cert for a new IP. |
| App loads on a phone but toggles/buttons appear dead | Your LAN IP is outside the `192.168` / `10` / `172.16` private ranges, so Next 16 blocked `/_next/*` assets. Add the specific origin to `allowedDevOrigins` in `frontend/next.config.mjs`. |
| Voice model select is greyed out | The model is **locked while connected** — disconnect first to change it. |
| Token I set in config has no effect on localhost | Intentional: the backend **never auto-loads `VC_AUTH_TOKEN` from a `.env` file** (opt-in per run mode), so localhost stays zero-config. It applies only in network mode, where `run-network.sh` exports it. |
| Config changes don't take effect | The writable config file is `~/Yuri/config/.env` (or `~/.config/yapcode/.env` on Homebrew). Edit it (or run `yapcode config`, or use the app's Setup screen) and restart. A `backend/.env` is read **last**, so editing that one has no effect on anything the other two set. Make sure you don't also have stale values exported in your shell, which win over every file — Setup flags this on the field when it happens. |
| First page load is slow | Without a production build (`frontend/.next/BUILD_ID`), the launcher runs `npm run dev`, which compiles the UI on first load. A `next build` produces the `BUILD_ID` and switches it to `npm run start`. |
| Sessions vanished after restart | yapcode can run Claude two ways — the default interactive **CLI** backend or the Agent **SDK** backend (see [Architecture](#architecture-for-contributors)). Only the CLI backend rehydrates detached tmux sessions on restart; SDK subprocesses die with the backend. Set `VC_KILL_SESSIONS_ON_SHUTDOWN=1` to kill on shutdown instead. |
| `brew install yapcode` can't find the formula | Tap it first: `brew tap nithiink/yapcode`, then `brew install yapcode`. If a fetch fails, `brew update` and retry; you can always fall back to the [clone install](#install-from-source). |

## Architecture (for contributors)

The whole point: **a spoken instruction becomes a real tmux action driving the live Claude CLI.**
The high-level pipeline is in [How it works](#how-it-works); below is the path through the code.

```

(WebRTC and WebSocket are just the realtime audio transports for the two provider families.)

**How a voice tool call becomes a tmux action:**

1. The voice model emits a `function_call` (e.g. `tell_claude`, `start_session`,
   `answer_prompt`). The frontend POSTs it to the Next `/api/tools/execute` proxy, which forwards
   to the backend `POST /tools/execute`.
2. `tools.dispatch_tool` (`backend/tools.py`) runs the tool. Long-running ones (`tell_claude`,
   `run_slash_command`, `answer_prompt`) return `{status:"working"}` immediately; the frontend
   polls and narrates when Claude is done.
3. The CLI runner (`backend/tmux_runner.py`) creates a detached tmux session named
   `vc_<handle[:8]>` running the interactive `claude` CLI. Input is `tmux send-keys`; output is
   read with `tmux capture-pane`. Permission decisions flow through a PreToolUse hook in
   `backend/tmux_hooks/`.
4. The browser's live terminal (`frontend/components/LiveTerminal.tsx`, xterm.js) bridges a
   PTY-over-WebSocket to the same tmux pane — closing it just *detaches*; the session keeps
   running. (This shared pane is what enables [co-driving](#co-driving-voice--keyboard-on-one-session).)

**Two Claude execution backends** share a `ClaudeRunner` interface (`backend/claude_runner.py`;
routing between backends lives in `backend/session_manager.py`):
`cli` → `TmuxClaudeRunner` (default; real interactive CLI, uses your Max subscription, supports
`--chrome`) and `sdk` → `SDKClaudeRunner` (Claude Agent SDK). Each session handle is a uuid owned
by one backend.

**Unified pipeline event bus** (`backend/event_log.py`): every hop (voice ↔ backend ↔ Claude) is
captured into one ordered stream feeding an in-memory ring buffer, live SSE subscribers (the
in-app *Activity log* via `/debug/stream`), and an append-only `debug-log.jsonl`. This is your
best friend when debugging.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome — this is MIT-licensed and built to be hacked on.

### Dev-mode setup (hot reload)

Both servers reload on change, so the inner loop is fast:

```bash
cd backend && ./run.sh             # uvicorn main:app --port 8000 --reload --reload-dir .
cd frontend && npm run dev         # next dev -H 127.0.0.1 -p 3000
```

- **Backend** runs with `uvicorn --reload`. The watcher is scoped to `backend/` (`--reload-dir .`)
  so the rapidly-written events log doesn't trigger reloads. With detach-on-shutdown, reload
  **preserves running CLI sessions** (they rehydrate on restart) — you rarely lose state.
- **Frontend** runs with `npm run dev` (Next dev server, loopback-bound on `127.0.0.1`).

### Dependency management

```bash
# Backend deps are lock-pinned with hashes
uv pip sync requirements.lock                                              # install from the lock
uv pip compile requirements.txt -o requirements.lock --generate-hashes    # regenerate
uv run --with pip-audit python -m pip_audit -r requirements.lock          # audit

# Frontend
npm ci                                                                    # lockfile-exact install
```

### Repo layout map (where things live)

| Path | What's there |
| --- | --- |
| `backend/main.py` | FastAPI app, endpoints, auth (`_access_ok`, `require_auth`, WS auth), lifespan/rehydration. |
| `backend/tools.py` | The voice-model tool list (`TOOL_DEFINITIONS`) + `dispatch_tool`. |
| `backend/tmux_runner.py` | The CLI runner — spawns/drives tmux + the `claude` CLI. |
| `backend/claude_runner.py` | `ClaudeRunner` interface + the SDK runner. |
| `backend/session_manager.py` | Session handles, project resolution, routing (cli vs sdk). |
| `backend/permissions.py` | Classifies tools as safe / question / risky. |
| `backend/slash_commands.py` | Slash-command discovery + execution. |
| `backend/event_log.py`, `cost_log.py` | Pipeline event bus + cost JSONL logging. |
| `backend/tmux_hooks/` | PreToolUse / Stop / Notification hooks wired into Claude. |
| `frontend/components/VoiceAgent.tsx` | The main UI: connect, timeline, sessions, prompts, cost. |
| `frontend/components/LiveTerminal.tsx` | xterm.js terminal over the PTY WebSocket. |
| `frontend/lib/realtime.ts`, `lib/gemini.ts` | The two voice transports (OpenAI/Azure WebRTC, Gemini Live WS). |
| `frontend/app/api/*` | Same-origin proxy to the backend (CSRF defense, auth pass-through). |

| `packaging/yapcode.rb`, `release.sh` | Homebrew formula + release script. |

> Tip: the in-app **Activity log** (SSE from `/debug/stream`) shows every voice ↔ backend ↔
> Claude event live — a great way to understand the pipeline before changing it.

### Good first contributions

- **Docs** — clarify setup, expand troubleshooting, improve the WSL2 path, or fix anything in
  this README that tripped you up.
- **Voice providers** — both transports implement one `VoiceSession` interface
  (`frontend/lib/voice.ts`: `start` / `stop` / `injectUpdate` / `setMuted`). Adding or improving
  a provider is well-isolated work; the backend mint logic lives in `backend/main.py`
  (`POST /session`).
- **Integrations** — extend the Claude Code plugin in `integrations/claude-code-plugin/` (e.g.
  the `/voice-handoff` flow).
- **New voice tools** — add to `TOOL_DEFINITIONS` + `dispatch_tool` in `backend/tools.py`.

### PR expectations

- Keep changes scoped; match existing style. The backend pins deps with hashes — if you touch
  `requirements.txt`, regenerate `requirements.lock`.
- Note any new env var, command, port, or flag in the README's [configuration reference](#configuration-reference).
- Test the path you changed locally (the localhost run is zero-config); note which provider(s) /
  OS you tested on, since transports and tmux behavior vary.
- Be explicit if a change affects the **security model** (auth, the directory sandbox,
  CORS/Origin/CSRF handling, redaction) — those need careful review and shouldn't be weakened
  without discussion.
- Don't commit secrets. The committed `cost-log.jsonl` / `debug-log.jsonl` will be scrubbed from
  history before the repo goes public; don't add to them.

> Releases are cut with `packaging/release.sh vX.Y.Z` (clean tree required; idempotent on the
> tag). Homebrew distribution goes live only after the repo is public and a tag exists.
