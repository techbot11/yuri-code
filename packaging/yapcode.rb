    # Launcher wrapper on PATH. The Cellar is read-only, so this relocates
    # everything the launcher would otherwise write inside the tree:
    #   (1) pins the install tree via YAPCODE_ROOT;
    #   (2) pins config via YAPCODE_CONFIG_DIR — a clone defaults config to
    #       $YURI_HOME/config/.env, and a Homebrew install keeps its .env in
    #       ~/.config/yapcode instead (survives brew upgrade / uninstall).
    #       Both bin/yapcode's CONF_DIR and setup_store.target_dir() honour
    #       this variable first, so the wizard, `yapcode config` and the app's
    #       Setup screen all write the same file here too;
    #   (3) redirects the backend's runtime writes (session store + logs) into
    #       the user's state dir.
    # Each `:=` respects a value the user already set, so overrides still win.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      yapcode is a front-end for Claude Code — it needs Claude Code
      installed and logged in (uses your existing subscription, no API key):
        https://claude.com/claude-code   (run `claude` once and sign in)

      First launch runs a short setup wizard (voice provider, key, allowed
      folders) and writes ~/.config/yapcode/.env. Then:

        yapcode up        # start the app and open it in your browser
        yapcode config    # edit settings later

      Config (~/.config/yapcode) and runtime state
      (~/.local/state/yapcode) live outside the Cellar and survive
      upgrades and uninstall.
    EOS

  test do
    # Unknown subcommand prints usage and exits 2 — exercises the launcher
    # without needing Claude Code, a voice key, or any prompt.
    output = shell_output("#{bin}/yapcode bogus-subcommand 2>&1", 2)
    assert_match "usage: yapcode", output
